                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p class="intro">
                    Growing up in rural Montana, I developed an early fascination for how things work‚Äîwhether it was fixing old gadgets or exploring the outdoors. This curiosity evolved into a passion for computers, mathematics, and building things from scratch. Today, I live in the Appalachian Mountains, where I combine that same inquisitive spirit with technical expertise to tackle real-world challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My path has been anything but linear. Along the way, I‚Äôve gained invaluable experience‚Äîfrom working in customer service to mastering programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++. My ability to connect with people and understand their needs has shaped my approach to software development. Whether I‚Äôm designing web applications, automating workflows, or analyzing data, I strive to deliver solutions that are as effective as they are user-friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I find joy in continuous learning. I view each project as an opportunity to push boundaries and connect diverse ideas‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm brainstorming creative solutions or applying advanced algorithms. I‚Äôm not afraid to dive deep into complex problems, knowing that innovation often lies just beneath the surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, you‚Äôll often find me exploring hiking trails, geeking out over the latest tech innovations, or gaming with friends. My life is a balance of creativity, logic, and adventure‚Äîqualities I bring to every project I undertake.
